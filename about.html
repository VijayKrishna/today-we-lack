<p>
"Today we Lack" is an attempt to harness the power of the internet and the data that it has accumulated over the years to understand what we as a people in India have been lacking for many years now, as reported by our news media. The premise of this website was simple: list out all the things that we lack in the country --- today, yesterday, the day before, or at any time in the past --- and someone, somewhere might want to do something about it.</p>

<p>We are collecting news headlines from websites such as the Times of India. From such a massive pool of headlines we are simply searching for those headlines that has the word 'lack' in it. We find that such headlines explicitly call out on things that we as a people lack, every now and then.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is all still a work in progress, and we expect to expand this to more news outlets and make the website more real-time. But, for now feel free to take a look at this list of things that India lacks, and tell us what you think about it by giving us a shoutout on twitter with the hashtag #todaywelack. Thank you all!</p>
